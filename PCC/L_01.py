# Python variables are read from top to bottom so if a global variable is changed at the end of a script then its final value is the most recent one
# Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. 
# Variables can't start with numbers
# Spaces can't be used in variable names so _ are often used in their place
# Upper case letters in variable names have special meanings.
